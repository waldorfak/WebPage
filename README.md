## Objective
This Repository is intended to collect and review the Design, Documentation and Issues for the webpage hosted at https://waldorfak.org/ for Anchorage Waldorf School. 

This Repository is NOT currently intended to hold the code for that Web Page.

### Resources
We have a [Wiki](https://github.com/waldorfak/WebPage/wiki) to review what we have done and hope to do.

You can also submit problems encountered or ideas for new features to our [Issue tracker](https://github.com/waldorfak/WebPage/issues)
